The `R` language is a very popular open-source language for statistical computing and visualization. We offer several versions of `R` which itself has access to an enormous library of packages from the [comprehensive R archive network](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) (CRAN). In this section we will show you how to install packages from CRAN on your account.

{% include important.html content='Extra documentation and guides can be found at <code><a href="https://marcc-hpc.github.io/esc/">marcc-hpc.github.io/esc</a></code>. Our <a href="https://marcc-hpc.github.io/esc/common/r-packages">latest set of software modules</a> also provides a method for using R packages directly from our module system' %}

## Selecting an `R` version

Recall that the [modules system](shortcourse_modules.html) is [hierarchical](shortcourse_modules.html#hierarchical-modules) which means that the software stack uses only a single compiler at one time. Since `R` will often compile codes when you install packages, it is essential that you *keep track of which `R` version you are using*. For this tutorial we will use the default Intel compiler and `R` version `3.5.1`. Load these modules with the following commands.

~~~
$ ml restore
$ ml intel
$ ml R/3.5.1
~~~

You may see a warning that tells you where `R` will install packages.

~~~
MARCC Info: R is loaded,
'/home-4/rbradle8@jhu.edu/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.5/intel/18.0' 
  is the default package location for user personal libraries; 
  we will attempt to create the package location if it does not exist. 
  Tired of this message? Type 'touch $HOME/.ignore_info' 
~~~

You are free to follow these instructions to suppress the message. Open the `R` terminal and check the library path. It exists inside your home directory, in a folder that specifies the `R` version and the compiler.

~~~
$ R

R is a collaborative project with many contributors.
Type 'contributors()' for more information and
'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.

Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or

[2] "/software/apps/R/3.5.1/intel/18.0/lib64/R/library"
~~~

As promised from the warning message, your personalized packages will be written to `~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.5/intel/18.0`. We recommend that you monitor the disk usage on your home directory because there is a `20 GB` limit. 

It is also essential to keep track of the `R` version and compiler you are using. We recommend including this in your workflow documentation.

## Installing packages

Installing a custom set of packages is relatively simple. We recommend [using an interactive session](shortcourse_interact.html) to do this so that you do not disturb other users on the login nodes. In the following example we will install `ggplot2`.

~~~
$ R
> install.packages('devtools')
# select a CRAN mirror
# installation takes a few minutes
~~~

You will see a number of compile steps required to build this package. Afterwards you can use the package with the `library` command.

~~~
> library('devtools')
~~~

### Additional compile flags

You may need to use additional compile flags when building packages in `R`. Here is an example `Makevars` file to accomplish this.

~~~
$ cat ~/.R/Makevars
CC=icc -std=gnu11
CXX1XSTD = -std=c++0xi
CXX_STD = CXX11
~~~

We recommend consulting the [R documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Using-Makevars) for more information.

### Visualization

If your analysis requires visualization, you have three options.

1. Use `X11` forwarding described in the [software prerequisites](shortcourse_prereq.html#tunneling-windows) section and the `ssh -X` or `ssh -Y` flags described in the [login](http://localhost:4000/shortcourse_login.html#graphical-interfaces) section.
2. Write images to disk and download them with `scp` using the method described in the [transferring files](shortcourse_transfer.html) section.
3. Use the [portal tools](https://www.marcc.jhu.edu/getting-started/interactive-development/).

### RStudio

If you are interested in graphical tools that provide R and Python in a web browser, see the [portal tools](https://www.marcc.jhu.edu/getting-started/interactive-development/) section of our website or skip to the [Jupyter section](shortcourse_portal_jupyter.html), which provides a detailed example using Jupyter which can also be used with `rstudio_server_start` to access RStudio.
