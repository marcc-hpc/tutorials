Users who encounter difficulty using MARCC should first consult our [main website](https://www.marcc.jhu.edu/) for information about technical details, updates to our software and hardware, and guides for the most common tasks. We also maintain extra documentation at [`marcc-hpc.github.io/esc`](https://marcc-hpc.github.io/esc). 

If you cannot find the answer to your question in this documentation, you may open a ticket with our help desk at:

[`marcc-help@marcc.jhu.edu`](mailto://marcc-help@marcc.jhu.edu)

It is essential that you are explicit as possible when opening a ticket. If you are encountering a specific problem when using our machine, please include the following details:

1. A clear description of what you are trying to accomplish.
2. A `SLURM` job ID number associated with your calculation.
3. The full path to your executable or a complete list of the software modules you are using.
4. The full path to an output file containing logs or error messages.
5. The relevant part of the error message.
6. A description of what your initial investigation has revealed.

We answer tickets in the order they are received.
